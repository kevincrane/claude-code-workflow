## Code to Improve
<!-- What code needs refactoring? File paths, functions, modules, etc. -->


## Why Refactor?
<!-- What's the problem with the current implementation? -->
- [ ] Difficult to understand/maintain
- [ ] Performance issues
- [ ] Code duplication
- [ ] Tech debt
- [ ] Preparing for new features
- [ ] Other:

## Proposed Approach
<!-- How should we improve it? What patterns or techniques? -->


## Success Criteria
<!-- How will we know the refactoring is successful? -->
- [ ] All existing tests still pass
- [ ] Behavior is unchanged (verified by tests)
- [ ] Code is more readable/maintainable
- [ ] Performance metrics (if applicable):
- [ ]

## Constraints
<!-- What must NOT change? -->
- Must maintain existing public API
- Must preserve all current behavior
-

## Risks & Mitigation
<!-- What could go wrong? How to minimize risk? -->


## Additional Context
<!-- Related issues, examples from codebase, references, etc. -->
